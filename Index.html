    <h3>n this mini challenge we are going to create a random insult generator. Hopefully, this will be a little 
        fun app to build and not something that you would actually use to insult people :) You will create three 
        different arrays of body parts, adjectives and random words and your mini app will turn them into a string 
        that creates a random insult.</h3>
    <h2>Output will be in console</h2>
